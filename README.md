The original Motor Controller Board developed by Andrew Stark for the University of New Orleans Robotics Club. It has served the club for
at least two years and is often referred to as the "Purple Board" due to the color of soldermask given it by the Osh Park fab shop.

The Motor Controller Board is used to control 4 stepper motors attached to mechanum wheels. To do this, we attach 4 of Pololu's DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver Carriers to a printed and populated board.

This board was developed within Eagle. We lost the .sch file on an old computer. We were able to get this .brd file back from Osh Park and are documenting its development here.
